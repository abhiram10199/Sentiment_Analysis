## Sentiment Analysis Project

This repository houses a Python project aimed at classifying sentiment in text data. The core focus is on building and evaluating a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model to differentiate between positive and negative sentiment within text reviews. 

The project encompasses data preprocessing, feature engineering using a Bag-of-Words model, model training, and performance evaluation. Experimentation includes exploring the impact of different word scoring methods on model accuracy.
